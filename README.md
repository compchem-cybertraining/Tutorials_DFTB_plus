1. Start by doing TDDFTB+ SP calculation in the `1_tddftb+` folder

2. Do the excitation analysis in `2_excitation_analysis` folder

3. Compute MD trajectory with 4_md

4. Then 3_nacs

5. (Optionally), you can do the excitation_analysis again, using the TDDFT+ calculations for a number of steps from step2


`legacy` is the old set of tutorials by Brendan Smith. Some of the current ones are based on those legacy examples
